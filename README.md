It extends the functionality to allow for searching empty bookmark names

  architecture that matches your machine: `x64` (more common) or `ARM64`

## Localization

There is no localization right now, but the plugin has relatively limited user-facing strings.

## Future Plans

- support other browsers
- localization

## Build

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\Build.ps1
```

For developing you can run the underlying powershell script to build the project and automatically copy the project to
your power toys run plugins

```shell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass  .\Dev-Build.ps1
```

> Script has to run with admin privileges 

> If you haven't installed powershell system-wide you might need to tweak some paths in `Dev-Build.ps1` to fit your environment

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to the project. Pull requests are welcome.  
Together we can build the perfect plugin
